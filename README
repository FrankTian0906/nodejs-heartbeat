This is the simpliest heartbeat algorithm you'll find for nodejs.

This library consists in two classes: one that waits for connections and other that connects and says it is alive. It'ss a simple tool to inspect if my remote servers are up or down ;)

The hb_client.js and hb_server.js inside src/ should suffice for you to understand how to run a heartbeat system between remote servers... 

To run the tests you will need nodeunit (npm nodeunit and you are done!)

contributors are always welcome.

have fun!
